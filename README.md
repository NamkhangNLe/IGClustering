# Social Network Analysis: User Separation and School Affiliation

This project aims to analyze the relationship between users' levels of separation and their school affiliations, with a specific focus on comparing Ivy League schools and Georgia Tech.

## Project Overview

The project uses data from Instagram user profiles, including who they follow and who follows them. The data is then used to construct a social graph, where each user is a node and each follow relationship is an edge.

## Key Questions

1. What is the average level of separation between users within the same school?
2. How does this level of separation compare between Ivy League schools and Georgia Tech?
3. Are users from Ivy League schools more interconnected than those from Georgia Tech?

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection**: We collect data from Instagram user profiles, including the list of users they follow and their followers.
2. **Graph Construction**: We construct a social graph using the collected data.
3. **Analysis**: We calculate the level of separation between users within the same school and compare these values between Ivy League schools and Georgia Tech.
